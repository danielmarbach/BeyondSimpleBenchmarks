# Beyond simple benchmarks—A practical guide to optimizing code with BenchmarkDotNet

It is vital for code executed at scale to perform well. It is crucial to ensure performance optimizations actually make the code faster. Luckily, we have powerful tools which help—BenchmarkDotNet is a .NET library for benchmarking optimizations, with plenty of simple examples to help get started.

In most systems, the code we need to optimize is rarely simple. It contains assumptions we need to discover before we even know what to improve. The code is hard to isolate. It has dependencies, which may or may not be relevant to optimization. And even when we've decided what to optimize, it's hard to reliably benchmark the before and after. Only measurement can tell us if our changes actually make things faster. Without them, we could even make things slower, without even realizing.

Understanding how to create benchmarks is the tip of the iceberg. In this talk, you'll also learn how to identify what to change, how to isolate code for benchmarking, and more. You'll leave with a toolkit of succinct techniques and the confidence to go ahead and optimize your code. 

## Brainstorming

- how to make performance optimization actionable
- putting a practical process in-place to isolate components, measure + change + measure again, without breaking current behavior. Rinse and repeat
- combine that with something like a macro benchmark to see how the small changes can all add up to real-world improvements for users
- What parameters have an impact on what I want to benchmark
- What are reasonable values for those parameters that make we reasonably certain I have a good comparison baseline without unnecessarily exploding the runtime of the benchmark
- Can I do a series of quick runs to get a feel of the direction I'm heading vs when are longer runs important
- Optimize existing things until you hit the point of diminishing return. Exploring those limits makes you learn a ton about potential improvements for a new design
- Starting with an NSB endpoint and explore factors that are in place that have an impact on the throughput. Iterate through all aspects of the stack.
- Present a few best practices of benchmarking while talking about these concrete examples
- How do I avoid getting too much into profilers?
